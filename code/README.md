Here's the scenario: a galactic overlord has hired you, a galactic web
developer, to develop a galactic web app that will allow them to browse through
a list of robots, view a robot's details, and, enlist a bot into their army.

## Instructions

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of available bots, among other features. Try your best to find the right
places to insert code into the established code base.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given
instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in
how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for
setting up the application.

## Setup
